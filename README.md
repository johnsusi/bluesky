**Introduction**

Bluesky is an opinionated application framework based on
[Clearwater](https://github.com/clearwater-rb/clearwater/).

This project grew out of about a years work on a large project using Opal
and Clearwater.

Note: Being opinionated means that this framework is not for everyone. The
      authors background is in desktop and mobile app development and that is of
      course reflected in the design. If things feel weird or you find yourself
      working against the framework then maybee this is not for you.
